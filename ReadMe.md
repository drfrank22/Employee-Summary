# Employee Summary

## Description

This project is a Command Line Interface (CLI) and allows a way for you to create an employee summary for your business. It will add in the manager for a team, as well as adding in engineers and interns for the manager. Future development for this app would allow for multiple managers, positions and roles to be updated and deleted as well. It also outputs an html document (if none exists already) with the information provided.
